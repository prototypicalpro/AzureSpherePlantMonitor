> **NOTE:** Incompatible failure mode changes in v2.0 compared to v1.x!

Introduction
------------

[libuEv][] is a small event loop that wraps the Linux `epoll()` family
of APIs.  It is similar to the more established [libevent][], [libev][]
and the venerable [Xt(3)][] event loop.  The *µ* in the name refers to
both its limited feature set and the size impact of the library.

Failure mode changes introduced in v2.0 may affect users of v1.x, See
the [ChangeLog][] for the full details.

The [API documentation](API.md) is available as a separate document.


Example
-------

Notice how watcher conditions like `UEV_ERROR` must be handled by each
callback.  I/O watchers must also check for `UEV_HUP`.  Both errors are
usually fatal, libuEv makes sure to stop each watcher before a callback
runs, leaving it up to the callback to take appropriate action.

```C
/* Set up a timer watcher to call cb() every other second */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <uev/uev.h>

static void cb(uev_t *w, void *arg, int events)
{
        if (UEV_ERROR == events) {
            puts("Problem with timer, attempting to restart.");
            uev_timer_start(w);
        }

        puts("Every other second");
}

int main(void)
{
        uev_ctx_t ctx;
        uev_t timer;

        uev_init(&ctx);
        uev_timer_init(&ctx, &timer, cb, NULL, 2 * 1000, 2 * 1000);

        return uev_run(&ctx, 0);
}
```


Build & Install
---------------

libuEv use the GNU configure and build system.  To try out the bundled
examples, use the `--enable-examples` switch to the `configure` script.
There is also a limited unit test suite that can be useful to learn how
the library works.

```sh
./configure
make -j5
make test
sudo make install-strip
sudo ldconfig
```

The resulting .so library is ~23 kiB.

To build from GIT sources; clone the repository and run the `autogen.sh`
script.  This requires GNU `automake`, `autoconf` amd `libtool` to be
installed on your system.  (If you build from a released tarball you do
not need them.)


Origin & References
-------------------

[libuEv][] is developed and maintained by [Joachim Nilsson][] on GitHub.
It is primarily built for and developed on GNU/Linux systems, patches to
support the BSD [kqueue][] interface are most welcome.

Originally based on [LibUEvent][] by [Flemming Madsen][], uEv has since
evolved to support all of the Linux `epoll()` family APIs.  It is now
more similar to the excellent [libev][] by [Mark Lehmann][], with some
inspiration also from [picoev][] by [Oku Kazuho][].
