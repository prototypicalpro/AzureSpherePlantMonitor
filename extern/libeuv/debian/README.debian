libuEv for Debian
-----------------

This is the upstream pre-packaged version of libuEv.  It consists of two
.deb packages: one with only the .so library and one -dev package with
headers and the .a library for static linking.  It builds on any Debian
based operating system, e.g.  Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.

Recommended reading is the upstream README and API docs.
