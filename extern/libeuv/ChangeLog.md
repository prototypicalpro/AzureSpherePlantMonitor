Change Log
==========

All notable changes to the project are documented in this file.


[v2.3.0][] - 2019-04-06
-----------------------

### Changes

- Support for Linux eventfd, `uev_event_*()` see [API.md][] for details


[v2.2.0][] - 2018-10-04
-----------------------

**NOTE:** You now have to explicitly include `sys/queue.h`, or provide a
          local version of `queue.h`, if your application depends on it.

### Changes
- Replaced BSD `queue.h` doubly-linked lst API with own implementation.
  Making libuEv stand-alone, no longer imposing any particular version
  of `queue.h` on the user
- Enforce `-std=gnu11` to unlock `typeof()` in older GCC versions
- Code cleanup

### Fixes
- Fix missing header deps. in `Makefile.am`, library did not rebuild
  properly if any of the local header files were changed


[v2.1.3][] - 2018-09-06
-----------------------

### Changes
- Update joystick example, use first device, `/dev/input/js0`
- Minor refactor of `uev_exit()`, use `_SAFE` macros to traverse
  list of watchers instead of `while()`
- New API test to verify that `uev_exit()` terminates properly
- Make `uev_signal_stop()` idempotent

### Fixes
- Let `uev_timer_stop()` call `close()` on the timerfd directly, do not
  call `uev_timer_set()` since that may cause lockups or hangs


[v2.1.2][] - 2018-02-27
-----------------------

### Changes
- Minor refactor of event loop after fixing the nasty use-after-free bug
  in v2.1.1.  Code can now be collapsed and noticeably simplified

### Fixes
- Issue #17: Check if `AM_PROG_AR` macro exists before calling it, fixes
  problem building libuEv on systems with older autoconf + automake.
  Patch by Markus Svilans
- Fix minor issue with unit tests, return result of test not event loop


[v2.1.1][] - 2018-01-28
-----------------------

### Fixes
- Fix use after free in main event loop if watcher deletes itself in
  the callback.  I.e., the callback must be the last action for the
  watcher in the event loop.
- Doc timer example fix by @tisyang
- Doc timer updates, non-zero timeout required


[v2.1.0][] - 2017-11-14
-----------------------

### Changes
- Remove event loop error tracking used to trigger a `epoll_create1()`
  at a certain error threshold.  This tracking was first introduced in
  [v1.1.0][], triggered by spurious `EPOLLERR` on I/O watchers
- Unconditionally stop I/O watchers that return `EPOLLERR` or `EPOLLHUP`
  it is up to the watcher callback to clear the error and/or `read()`
  the last few bytes from the descriptor.  HUP usally means EOF, or that
  the remote end of a stream or pipe closed, this may also be signaled
  by `read()` returning zero
- Add missing `--enable-examples` to `configure` script
- Update documentation, both [README.md][] and [API.md][]

### Fixes
- Properly stop and de-register signal and cron/timer watchers from the
  epoll socket in case of errors, problem introduced in [v2.0.0][]
- Mark watcher file descriptor as unintialized on internal error
- Fix double-close of cron/timer watchers.  Problem triggered when the
  timer expires and calls `uev_exit()`, which stops all watchers.  When
  the timer callback returns another call to stop the watcher triggered
  the double `close()`
- Fix unit test's error handling in watcher callbacks, for reference
- Fix use-before-set in cronrun unit test
- Make sure to restart unit test's I/O watchers on `UEV_ERROR`
- Make sure to restart example I/O watchers on `UEV_ERROR`
- Properly check for `UEV_HUP` in unit tests and examples


[v2.0.0][] - 2017-11-11
-----------------------

Beware, this is a major release, introducing incompatible changes to the
failure modes of `uev_run()` and watcher callbacks.  Most users will most
likely not notice any difference, but please read on.

### Changes
- `uev_run()` no longer exits the main event loop if an unrecoverable
  error with a watcher occurs.  Instead, the watcher is disabled and the
  callback is run one last time with `events` set to `UEV_ERROR`
- Watcher callbacks must handle `UEV_ERROR` conditions.  This pertains
  in particular to signal and timer watchers
- Examples and API docs updated with the new failure modes


[v1.6.0][] - 2017-09-18
-----------------------

### Changes
- Support for edge triggered and oneshot event types
- Add `make package` build target to trigger a `.deb` package build
- Support 64 bit `time_t` on 32 bit GLIBC systems

### Fixes
- `bench.c`: Use `signal.h`, not non-standard `sys/signal.h`


[v1.5.2][] - 2016-11-27
-----------------------

### Fixes
- Fix build regression in v1.5.1


[v1.5.1][] - 2016-11-27
-----------------------

### Changes
- Add support for checking if a watcher is active.
- Refactor unit testing framework


[v1.5.0][] - 2016-10-30
-----------------------

### Changes
- Add support for absolute timers with the `uev_cron_*()` API.
- Update build & install instructions in [README.md][]

### Fixes
- Fix `uev_timer_set()` so that it returns error in case the underlying
  Linux timerfd API fails.


[v1.4.2][] - 2016-06-25
-----------------------

### Changes
- Add range checks for `period` and `timeout` to `uev_timer_init()` and
  `uev_timer_set()`.  If either on is `< 0` libuEv now return `ERANGE`.


[v1.4.1][] - 2016-04-22
-----------------------

### Changes
- Add some `pkg-config` integration tips for developers using libuEv
  with GNU autotools in their projects.

### Fixes
- Add missing `SFD_CLOEXEC` and `TFD_CLOEXEC` to signal and timer file
  descriptors.  This prevents these file descriptors from "leaking" into
  sub-processes of the parent thread.  The kernel will atomically close
  these descriptors for forked-off children calling the exec*() family
  of syscalls.
- Minor coding style fixes and simplification of build scripts.


[v1.4.0][] - 2016-03-22
-----------------------

This release changes the header file namespace, which was silently
introduced in [v1.2.1][].  Apologies for any problems this may cause!

### Changes
- Change namespace for header files: `libuev/` to `uev/`, e.g. using
  `pkg-config` your C program must now `#include <uev/uev.h>`
- Support for `EPOLLPRI` events for I/O watchers, thanks to Markus Svilans
- Simplified joystick example
- Updated [README.md][] slightly


[v1.3.1][] - 2016-02-02
-----------------------

### Fixes
- Remove symlinks to Markdown files from GIT
- Distribute and install Markdown files: [README.md][], etc.


[v1.3.0][] - 2016-01-22
-----------------------

### Changes
- Change to GNU configure and build system
- Default optimization is now `-O2`, not `-Os`, which can be a bit
  unpredictable with some cross compiler toolchains.  `-O2` is the
  tried and tested path, and default in autotools
- Added `-Wextra` to the previous `-W -Wall`, drop `-Werror`
  which is supposed to be used by maintainer(s) only.


[v1.2.4][] - 2015-11-23
-----------------------

### Fixes

- Do not allow `VERSION` to be overloaded by build system.
- Make sure we don't inherit `LDFLAGS` from environment.


[v1.2.3][] - 2015-09-17
-----------------------

Very minor release.

### Changes
- [README.md][] updates, mostly cleanup and readability improvements
- `make test` now runs the test case, on behalf of Travis-CI
- Renamed CHANGELOG.md to [ChangeLog.md][]
- Dropped [TODO.md][] from distribution archives, only for devs

### Fixes
- Lots of Markdown syntax fixes in both [README.md][] and ChangeLog
- Silence annoying warning from newer GNU ar in Ubuntu 15.10


[v1.2.2][] - 2015-08-30
-----------------------

Minor bugfix release.

### Changes
- The `ifdef STATIC` in the Makefile has been removed.  Now both the
  .a and .so libraries are built.  The user may then select what to
  install.  This is a change for convenience when using libuEv from
  a GNU Configure & Build based project.

### Fixes
- Fix odd data ordering issue on Debian Jessie in new `uev_private_t`
- Fix issue #6: Segfault when stopping timer before calling `uev_exit()`


[v1.2.1][] - 2015-07-02
-----------------------

### Changes
- Private data members in `uev.h` have now been moved to a new file
  called `private.h`.  This will hopefully make it easier to understand
  what a user of libuEv is allowed to play around with.  Thanks to @vonj
  for the discussions around this!
- All builds of libuEv now default to use `-fPIC`, this bloats the code
  slightly, but ensures that linking works for all use cases, withouth
  introducing unnecessary complexity.

### Fixes
- Fix install/uninstall Makefile recipes so they work for both static
  and dynamic builds.  Also, make sure to install all required headers.
- Jakob Eriksson noticed that `O_CLOEXEC` does not exist in the Debian 6
  EGLIBC, but `EPOLL_CLOEXEC` does, and is also what `epoll_create1()`
  should use.  Thank you @vonj!


[v1.2.0][] - 2015-06-09
-----------------------

API change in event callbacks and fix timers that never start.

### Changes
- Remove first `uev_ctx_t *` argument in callbacks, incompatible API
  change!  Please update all your callbacks if you upgrade.

### Fixes
- Fix timers that accidentally broke in [v1.1.0][].
- Fixes to `bench.c`, it now actually listens to the pipe/socket.


[v1.1.0][] - 2015-03-04
-----------------------

Massively improved error handling.

### Changes
- Handle case when user closes a descriptor *before* stopping a watcher.
- Handle `EPOLLHUP` and `EPOLLERR`.  Restart `epoll(7)` descriptor and
  all watchers when an error count reaches a MAX value -- handles stale
  descriptors or cases when kernel does not notice updated descriptors.
- Return error when stopping a watcher fails.
- Update [README.md][] with new `uev_*_start()` functions.
- Bump dev version to 1.1 due to the number of significant changes.

### Fixes
- Remove `test.c` from `DISTFILES` in `Makefile`.  You need the
  comeplete sources to build the examples now.  Thanks to @karasz for
  the heads up on this and the musl libc issue with missing `queue.h`!
- Fix broken link to [v1.0.5][] in this file.


[v1.0.5][] - 2015-02-15
-----------------------

### Changes
- Add `uev_*_start()` functions.
- Add slightly odd `examples/signal.c` example that utilises `fork()`
  and causes segfault in child.
- Renamed `main.c` to `uev.c`
- Move examples to `examples/` subdirectory
- Simplify automatic dependency calculation
- Add [TODO.md][] for wishlist items
- Add [CHANGELOG.md][ChangeLog.md], to align with http://keepachangelog.com
- Further updates to [README.md][]


[v1.0.4][] - 2015-01-24
-----------------------

Minor documentation and build fixes.

Release mainly targeted for [Finit development](https://github.com/troglobit/finit/).

### Changes
* `test.c` has been simplified/clarified
* Further updates to [README.md][]
* Minor update to Makefile, change how build progress is echoed


[v1.0.3][] - 2015-01-24
-----------------------

### Changes
- [README.md][], massively updated
- API documentation, updated
- Travis CI integration added, https://travis-ci.org/troglobit/libuev
- Coverity Scan integration, https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3846
- Clang scan-build support added


[v1.0.2][] - 2015-01-07
-----------------------
