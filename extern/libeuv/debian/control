Description: static library, header files, and docs for libuev
 Static library, header files, and documentation for libuEv
 .
 libuEv is a small event loop that wraps the Linux epoll() family of APIs.
 It is similar to the more established libevent, libev and the venerable
 Xt(3) event loop. The u (micro) in the name refers to both its limited
 feature set and the small size impact of the library.
 .
 Experienced developers may appreciate libuEv is built on top of modern
 Linux APIs like epoll, eventfd, timerf, and signalfd.
